/**
 * Computes the distance between HMMs.
 * <p>
 * The distance metric is similar to the Kullback-Leibler distance defined on
 * distributions. More information can be found in
 * <i>A Probabilistic Distance Measure For HMMs</i> by
 * <i>Rabiner</i> and <i>Juang</i> (AT&T Technical Journal, vol. 64, Feb. 1985,
 * pages 391-408).
 * <p>
 * This distance measure is not symmetric: <code>distance(hmm1, hmm2)</code> is
 * not necessary equal to <code>distance(hmm2, hmm1)</code>. To get a symmetric
 * distance definition, compute
 * <code>(distance(hmm1, hmm2) + distance(hmm2, hmm1)) / 2</code>.
