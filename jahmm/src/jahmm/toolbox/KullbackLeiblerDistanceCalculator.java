 * <i>Rabiner</i> and <i>Juang</i> (AT&T Technical Journal, vol. 64, Feb. 1985,

 * This distance measure is not symmetric: <code>distance(hmm1, hmm2)</code> is
 * not necessary equal to <code>distance(hmm2, hmm1)</code>. To get a symmetric
 * distance definition, compute
 * <code>(distance(hmm1, hmm2) + distance(hmm2, hmm1)) / 2</code>.
